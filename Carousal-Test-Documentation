Please find below my approach in developing this carousal 

(1).  I First developed App.js which bacsically contains 2 components - Header and Carousal

(2). Header component is same in both mobile and desktop layout hence no need to make any change in it and simply we can use same components for both layout.

(3). Carousal componetnt is basically a container component depending on the viewport width. If viewport width is less than or equal to 480px simply render MobileCarousalComponent else DesktopCarousalComponent.

(4). In Desktop Carousal Component there is a seprate section for Prev and Next button. In MObile carousal component "next" and "previous" button is present in sideways of image.

(5). Callback function for action on clicking on "previous" and "next" button is handled in App.js as callback function as React basically is based on uni-directional flow.
